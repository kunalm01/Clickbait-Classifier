# Clickbait-Classifier


## Introduction
This is a simple clickbait classifier developed using a bidirectional LSTM neural network. The model is trained on a dataset of headlines labeled as clickbait or not clickbait. The code is written in Python and uses TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building and training the neural network.
